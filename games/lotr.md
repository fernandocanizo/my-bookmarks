# LOTR Rise to War

  Commander guides, calculators, etc.

  A good inspiration site to copy and improve stuff. For example, the troop stats shows on a new page and you have to go back and forth to check different troops. Also, it lacks a comparison. I would implement a form that, first, shows the troop stats on the side, without navigating to a new view. And second, allows to compare to another troop.

  Also, when it comes to troops, you want to know how many can you build with a set of resources and also how much time will it take.

  His site, at least now 2024-10-09, doesn't have the costs and gives a "time for full formation", which I don't know what it is. Better to have the time calculated according to the amount of units you want to produce.
