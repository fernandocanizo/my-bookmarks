# Possible Open Source Projects to Collaborate

- 2023-04-12 [node-help](https://github.com/foundling/node-help)
  Project seems abandoned and doesn't work (throws some error when I tried to
  run it). It claimed to provide help for Nodejs up to version 10, I'm
  interested in making it more automatic and make it able to produce help for
  any new version.

  Seems like a cool project to hack in.

  Also it seems the CLI REPL universe is pretty much limited to the simple
  Nodejs REPL, which is awful. Maybe one can build a cooler one. Look for
  stdlib.io repl to build one.

  [nesh](https://danielgtaylor.github.io/nesh/) claims some of the stuff I'm
  searching (except a cooler editor), but it seems unmaintained. Lots of
  warning about deprecated libraries when installing, an error on launch and
  the `.doc` feature doesn't work (maybe because the error on launch). So it's
  a no go.

  [ijs](https://github.com/interactivecomputing/ijs) requires a browser.
