# Possible Open Source Projects to Collaborate

- 2023-04-12 [node-help](https://github.com/foundling/node-help)
  Project seems abandoned and doesn't work (throws some error when I tried to
  run it). It claimed to provide help for Nodejs up to version 10, I'm
  interested in making it more automatic and make it able to produce help for
  any new version.

  Seems like a cool project to hack in.
