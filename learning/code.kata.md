# Coding Katas and Alike

- [HackerRank](https://www.hackerrank.com/)
  My main site for praticing coding.

- [Exercism](https://exercism.org)
  Not only code exercises, but also mentoring. Actual people checking your code
  and telling ways to improve.

  Haven't tried it, but maybe this is better than HackerRank and others.

- [GeeksForGeeks](https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/)
  Not only katas, this sites has courses, tutorials, full learning paths for several subjects, jobs and katas.

- [Edabit](https://edabit.com)
  Once the basics are learned, you will realize everything is made for either a
  total beginner or an advanced coder. Edabit bridges this gap. You start on
  easy and progress at your own pace until you're able to master the toughest
  coding exercises.

  Haven't tried it yet.

  A community driven platform to share knowledge. CodinGame uses this platform to pull in exercises.
