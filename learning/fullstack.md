# FullStack Development

- [Full Stack open](https://fullstackopen.com/en/)

From University of Helsinki.

Learn React, Redux, Node.js, MongoDB, GraphQL and TypeScript in one go! This course will introduce you to modern JavaScript-based web development. The main focus is on building single page applications with ReactJS that use REST APIs built with Node.js.

The course is totally free of charge. You can get a certificate and even the University of Helsinki ECTS credits for free.

The course is worth 5-14 credits, and the content is the same as in the Full stack course held at the Department of Computer Science at the University of Helsinki in Spring 2023.
