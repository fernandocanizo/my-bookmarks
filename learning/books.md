# Books for learning stuff and sites to download books

## Sites

- [Ebook Foundation - Free Programming Books](https://github.com/EbookFoundation/free-programming-books)

- [Z Library](http://bookszlibb74ugqojhzhg2a63w5i2atv5bqarulgczawnbmsb6s6qead.onion/)
  Only accessible via tor network.

  **2025-01-15:** probably that link won't work anymore, here are two new:
  - [Zlib normal](https://z-library.sk/)
  - [Zlib through Onion](http://bookszlibb74ugqojhzhg2a63w5i2atv5bqarulgczawnbmsb6s6qead.onion/)

  **2025-08-25:**
  Found a Discord channel and two new sites that claim to be the official ones, I'm not sure if they are real or not yet.
  - [Zibrary Official](https://zlib-official.com/)
  - [Secondary](https://z-library.co/)

  Tried to login with my old credentials and it said it didn't exist, so I re-created my account.

  Links from 2025-01-15 still work and it's less hassle to download stuff, but you must use Onion.

  Also found this, only accesible via Tor, seems to be the same, but an older version:
  - [LibGen](http://libgen.gs/)
    Tried to download something from here and didn't found any download button, too clunky version.

- [Annas](https://annas-archive.org/)
  Mirror for Z Library and other sources.

  > It may be opinionated or incomplete at times but we hope this fills a certain void in online resources. We recommend using this alongside the [OWASP Cheat Sheet Series](https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/index.html)
