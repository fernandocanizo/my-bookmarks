# Drawing

- [DrawSpace](https://drawspace.com/)
  Years ago, maybe around 2010, I found this site and it had all it's resources for download free of charge. Now it has some stuff free and most of the stuff paid, I guess it was the natural course of action. It's still a good place to learn to draw, I believe. However you cannot download everything like before. I haven't checked the prices either.
