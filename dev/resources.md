# Resources for development

## Icons

- [HeroIcons](https://heroicons.com/)

- [FontAwesome](https://fontawesome.com/)
  Pretty cool and complete, however the free set is small, and the paid stuff is recurrent, so maybe look for better options or you'll have to pay forever.

## Fake data

- [JSON Placeholder](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/)
  JSONPlaceholder comes with a set of 6 common resources:

  /posts	100 posts
  /comments	500 comments
  /albums	100 albums
  /photos	5000 photos
  /todos	200 todos
  /users	10 users

  Also, resources have relations.
