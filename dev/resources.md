# Resources for development

## Icons

### Open Source

- [HeroIcons.Dev](https://heroicons.dev/) **Open Source**
  Great set and useful site providing you with the SVG inlined in a component ready to copy&paste into your code base. No need to add new dependencies to your project and maintain it updated.

  It's also living in [HeroIcons.Com](https://heroicons.com/), but that site has less features.

- [TablerIcons](https://tabler-icons.io/) **Open Source**

- [SVG Repo](https://www.svgrepo.com/)
  Get CRAZY!

- [GetBootstrap Icons](https://icons.getbootstrap.com/)
  Comes in an npm package, but you can also copy the SVG from the page. Doesn't have a search box though, and CTRL-F doesn't work on the page, so it's kind of a boomer :'(

- [Iconoir](https://iconoir.com/)
  SVG download plus you can tune the size, color and stroke width.

- [Open Iconic - GitHub](https://github.com/iconic/open-iconic)

- [Feather Icons](https://feathericons.com/)

- [IconQuix](https://iconquix.com/)

- [Ionic Icons](https://ionic.io/ionicons)

- [CSS.gg](https://css.gg/)
  Provides SVG icons, but also some are in pure CSS.

- [Eva Icons - GitHub](https://github.com/akveo/eva-icons) / [- Site](https://akveo.github.io/eva-icons/)

- [Remix Icons - GitHub](https://github.com/Remix-Design/remixicon) / [- Site](https://remixicon.com/)
  Site provides a nice UI to customize the icon and download modified SVG.

- [Octicons - GitHub](https://github.com/primer/octicons) / [- Site](https://primer.style/foundations/icons)

- [Ikonate - GitHub](https://github.com/mikolajdobrucki/ikonate) / [- Site](https://ikonate.com/)
  Sadly the UI doesn't show you the SVG code, you have to select the ones you want and upon "Export"ing it will download an ZIP file. Ugly!

### Paid, but some free or even open sourced

- [FontAwesome](https://fontawesome.com/)
  Pretty cool and complete, however the free set is small, and the paid stuff is recurrent, so maybe look for better options or you'll have to pay forever.

- [Flowbite Icons](https://flowbite.com/icons/)
  Paid resource but has some open-sourced. Provides SVG code.

## Data & Fake data

- [JSON Placeholder](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/)
  JSONPlaceholder comes with a set of 6 common resources:

  /posts	100 posts
  /comments	500 comments
  /albums	100 albums
  /photos	5000 photos
  /todos	200 todos
  /users	10 users

  Also, resources have relations.

- [Star Wars API](https://swapi.dev/)
  Tons of data about Star Wars universe.
