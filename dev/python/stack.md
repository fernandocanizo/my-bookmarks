# Python Tools & Libraries Stack

## Virtual environment

Just use `python -m venv <your-virtual-environment>`

## Static Analysis

- [black](https://github.com/psf/black)
  Coding style auto-formatter 

- [flake8](https://flake8.pycqa.org/en/latest/)
  Syntax linting and code analysis (also code style, but Black builds on top
  of `pycodestyle` from this package)

- [mypy](https://www.mypy-lang.org/)
  Type analysis

## Interpreter

Haven't decided to fully commit with one, I like things from all three, so
until I have a more strong opinion on one, I'll keep trying them all:


- [ipython](https://ipython.org/)
- [bpython](https://bpython-interpreter.org/)
- [ptpython](https://github.com/prompt-toolkit/ptpython)

## Package manager

Why should I use other thing than [pip]( https://pypi.org/)?
