  Found this library that's a fork of [Radash](https://github.com/sodiray/radash/), which seems to be unmaintained. I don't know if it's a functional library, hence the new sub-section to denote that, but Radash claims to be an improvement over Lodash by not providing methods that already are part of Javascript, and instead provide functions that do needed and more convoluted stuff.

  Radashi claims to be an improvement over Radash, but it's not clear in which manner. In the README they say:
  > “What makes Radashi so great?”

  And list a bunch of stuff that's not verifiable or it's not clear in which way is "well-designed" for example, or that are plain lies, like "well-documented", since there's no documentation and they send you to read Radash's documentation instead.

  So I'm not clear if this will be useful or not, but I'd like to keep an eye on it.
