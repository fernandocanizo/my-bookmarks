  Signals are reactive primitives for managing application state.

  What makes Signals unique is that state changes automatically update components and UI in the most efficient way possible. Automatic state binding and dependency tracking allows Signals to provide excellent ergonomics and productivity while eliminating the most common state management footguns.

  Signals are effective in applications of any size, with ergonomics that speed up the development of small apps, and performance characteristics that ensure apps of any size are fast by default.
