# Code Quality

- [SonarQube](https://www.sonarqube.org/)
  Static code analisys for code smells, bugs, vulnerabilities, complexity,
  duplication and more.

  **Didn't try yet. It's not just "install and run". Needs some
  configuration**

- [GitInspector](https://github.com/ejwa/gitinspector)
  Gives you statistics by author. Also can report violations of code metrics.

  **2022-04-13** tried it and didn't work. There's no clear instructions about
  installation. I did `npm i -g gitinspector`. But then I installed distribution
  (Arch) package and worked perfectly.

- [MemLab](https://facebook.github.io/memlab/)
  Analyzes JavaScript heap and finds memory leaks in browser and node.js

  **Didn't try yet**
