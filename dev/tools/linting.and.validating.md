# Linting and validating tools

- [JSON Validator](https://jsonlint.com/) - 2020.06.15

- [GeoJson Validator](https://geojsonlint.com/) - 2020.06.15

- [PubLint](https://publint.dev/)
  Is a package validator. Useful to test your packages or also dependencies you plan to use to see if they have good quality. Also good to discriminate which package is producing an ESM/CJS problem when you don't know exactly which one is the responsible, example: Remix vs Radix-ui.

- [Are The Types Wrong?](https://arethetypeswrong.github.io/)
  Another one in the same vein as PubLint, I feel it more informational and also points to good documentation about the problem and possible fixes.
