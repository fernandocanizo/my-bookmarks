# Uno CSS

- [Uno CSS](https://unocss.dev/)
  A better atomic CSS library. Claims to have better DX than Tailwind.
  > UnoCSS is an engine instead of a framework because there are no core utilities - all the functionalities are provided via presets or inline configurations. We are imagining UnoCSS being able to simulate the functionalities of most of the existing atomic CSS frameworks. And possibly have been used as the engine to create some new atomic CSS frameworks!
