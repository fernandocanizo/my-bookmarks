## C&P UI Components libraries

There are component libraries that expose their components in a way that's easy to copy&paste without having to actually install the library.

- [Shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/)

- [Mamba UI](https://mambaui.com/)

- [Meraki UI](https://merakiui.com/)

- [Flowbite UI](https://flowbite.com/)

- [Aceternity](https://ui.aceternity.com/)
  A **very** cool component library that doesn't provide basic stuff like others, but cool, elaborated components. Use it to give a touch of _wow!_ to your site.

- [BaseCoat UI](https://basecoatui.com/)
  All of the shadcn/ui magic, none of the React
  A components library built with Tailwind CSS that works with any web stack.
  (a non-tailwind version is coming)

### Accesible components

- [JollyUI](https://jollyui.dev/)
  > JollyUI aims to take the components offered by shadcn-ui, and translate them to use react-aria-components where possible.
  > Its intended as an add-on essentially, but can work as a standalone. All components found in this library should work with your existing shadcn/ui components and theme

- [Draf UI](https://draft-ui.com/)
  > Draft UI is a collection of simply designed React components focused on making web accessibility as easy as copy & paste.
  Takes the idea of providing source code from Shadcn, but these components are made from scratch with Tailwind directly.

## Themes

- [Shadcn Themes](https://ui.shadcn.com/themes)

- [jln dev](https://ui.jln.dev/)
  +10,000 themes for Shadcn/ui

## Colors

- [Default Palette Cheatsheet](https://uicolors.app/browse/tailwind-colors)
  In the `Browse` link shows basic default colors from Tailwind. But it can also be used as a theme generator based on a primary color. It offers several other cool services, but all of them paid.

- [Palettte](https://palettte.app/)
  Didn't tried, recommended in Tailwind docs.

- [ColorBox](https://colorbox.io/)
  Didn't tried, recommended in Tailwind docs.

- [Tint](https://www.tints.dev/)
  Palette generator

- [Tailwind CSS color palette generator](https://tailcolor.com/)
  Instantly generate a ready to use color palette for your Tailwind project.

- [Tailwind Ink](https://tailwind.ink/)
  Let's you select a primary color and builds (I think using AI) a full theme. I don't like it provides it as tailwind conf instead of CSS variables and also that it uses RGB sharp code instead of HSV. But it's pretty cool.

## Tools


- [Sly CLI](https://sly-cli.fly.dev/)
  Claims to give you the source and not install a package and that "this is how shadcn/ui should have been", but it's something Shadcn/ui already does. Maybe didn't do it at the beginning.

  Anyway, it provides access to several other libraries, installing directly the code in your repo instead of a package.

- [Shadxn](https://ui.shadxn.com/)
  On the same vein as Sly, based on Shadcn, but including other components libraries besides Shadcn
