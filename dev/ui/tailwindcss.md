## C&P UI Components libraries

There are component libraries that expose their components in a way that's easy to copy&paste without having to actually install the library.

- [Shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/)

- [Mamba UI](https://mambaui.com/)

- [Meraki UI](https://merakiui.com/)

- [Flowbite UI](https://flowbite.com/)

### Accesible components

- [JollyUI](https://jollyui.dev/)
  > JollyUI aims to take the components offered by shadcn-ui, and translate them to use react-aria-components where possible.
  > Its intended as an add-on essentially, but can work as a standalone. All components found in this library should work with your existing shadcn/ui components and theme

- [Draf UI](https://draft-ui.com/)
  > Draft UI is a collection of simply designed React components focused on making web accessibility as easy as copy & paste.
  Takes the idea of providing source code from Shadcn, but these components are made from scratch with Tailwind directly.

## Themes

  +10,000 themes for Shadcn/ui

## Tools


- [Sly CLI](https://sly-cli.fly.dev/)
  Claims to give you the source and not install a package and that "this is how shadcn/ui should have been", but it's something Shadcn/ui already does. Maybe didn't do it at the beginning.

  Anyway, it provides access to several other libraries, installing directly the code in your repo instead of a package.
