I thought it has AI integrated, but no, you connect with an AI API Gateway, so
I connected Open AI, but I have to pay. So I couldn't do a thorough test on
the formatting capabilities.

While it seems to have many integrations and cool stuff, I didn't find it
useful for my current tasks.

Generate React code with AI. I guess it's a tunned AI, so it's worth a try.

An open-source OCR model that accurately scans books with heavy math/scientific notations. Ages ahead of other open OCR options.

## General chat AI

  Ex Bard

- [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com/)

- [Aria](https://www.opera.com/features/aria)
  There's no link (I haven't looked for it thoroughfully) to use Aria from the web, it comes integrated with Opera Browser.

- [Devian](https://devinai.ai/)
  Claims to be "The First AI Software Engineer Cognition". An autonomous AI software engineer, you can give it not so much deep-explained request and it will take care of everything.

  **2024-03-27:** haven't used yet, but subscribed to the waiting queue. They show on its YouTube channel amazing things being done with it, but so far I couldn't testd it.

  Wait, now there's a "Try it for free" that leads to a different domain where you can see chats from other people (examples) and I think one can start a new chat too. Gonna try it later.
