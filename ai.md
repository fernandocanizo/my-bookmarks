I thought it has AI integrated, but no, you connect with an AI API Gateway, so
I connected Open AI, but I have to pay. So I couldn't do a thorough test on
the formatting capabilities.

While it seems to have many integrations and cool stuff, I didn't find it
useful for my current tasks.

Generate React code with AI. I guess it's a tunned AI, so it's worth a try.

An open-source OCR model that accurately scans books with heavy math/scientific notations. Ages ahead of other open OCR options.

## General chat AI

  Ex Bard

- [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com/)

- [Aria](https://www.opera.com/features/aria)
  There's no link (I haven't looked for it thoroughfully) to use Aria from the web, it comes integrated with Opera Browser.

  Claims to be "The First AI Software Engineer Cognition". An autonomous AI software engineer, you can give it not so much deep-explained request and it will take care of everything.

  **2024-03-27:** haven't used yet, but subscribed to the waiting queue. They show on its YouTube channel amazing things being done with it, but so far I couldn't testd it.

  Wait, now there's a "Try it for free" that leads to a different domain where you can see chats from other people (examples) and I think one can start a new chat too. Gonna try it later.
